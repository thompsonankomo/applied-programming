# Overview
I am creating a  console   App that will help me learn extensively about how C# works  and I will use this for my future projects.

The application begins by greeting the user with a "Hello World" message and provides a brief introduction to the console app. It showcases basic functionalities like reading from a text file, performing equality and comparison operations, and displaying random numbers

{The purpose of writing this software is primarily educational, aimed at demonstrating fundamental programming concepts in C#. It serves as a tool for learning and practicing essential skills such as file handling, conditional logic, and arithmetic operations.}

# Development Environment

In developing the C# console application, the following tools were utilized:

Integrated Development Environment (IDE):

Visual Studio: This is the primary IDE used for writing, testing, and debugging the C# application. It offers powerful features such as IntelliSense for code completion, debugging tools, and a user-friendly interface that facilitates coding and project management.

.NET Framework:

The application is built using the .NET framework, which provides a platform for developing and running C# applications. It includes libraries for various functionalities, such as file handling and input/output operations.

Version Control:

Git: Version control is managed using Git, allowing for tracking changes to the codebase and collaboration with others if needed. It helps maintain a history of the project's development and facilitates easy rollbacks if necessary.
