# Overview


I am building a Stock Controller App for my company, ThomPrim Investments, to track all stocks in real-time and provide the remaining stock based on Point of Sale (POS) statistics.

The software is written using Java as the backend language, with HTML and CSS for the front-end, creating a web-based user app where stock can be managed and updated. My purpose in writing this software is to develop a  stock management system that not only tracks items sold in real-time but also provides up-to-date inventory for logistical planning and restocking.

Development Environment
For developing this Stock Controller App, I used:

Visual Studio Code: My main code editor for Java, HTML, and CSS.
Java JDK 17: The Java Development Kit provides the necessary libraries and tools to develop the backend.

Google Chrome (for front-end testing): To test the interface and responsiveness of the HTML and CSS.
Programming Languages and Libraries
The backend logic is implemented in Java. I used:

Java I/O libraries to handle file reading and writing for persistent storage.
HashMap from Java Collections to store stock data.
The front end uses:

HTML for structuring the user interface.
CSS for styling the layout, centering elements, and enhancing user experience.
Useful Websites
Here is a list of websites that were helpful throughout the project:

Java Documentation - For understanding Java classes and methods.
MDN Web Docs - HTML & CSS - For front-end HTML and CSS references and best practices.
Stack Overflow - For troubleshooting and exploring different coding solutions.
Future Work
To improve and expand the Stock Controller App, I plan to work on the following:

Integrate with Spring Boot: Transition the backend to Spring Boot for better scalability and integration with databases.
Implement RESTful APIs: Enable a more interactive front-end experience by connecting the backend and front end with RESTful APIs.
Add User Authentication: Enhance security by adding login features to restrict access to authorized users.
Improve Front-End Responsiveness: Ensure the web app is fully responsive and can be accessed from mobile devices.
Enable Data Analytics: Add reports and analytics to visualize sales trends and inventory needs over time.
